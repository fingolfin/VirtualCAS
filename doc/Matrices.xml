  The package &VirtualCAS; defines the classes of virtual
  rings, ring elements and matrices over such rings. These three
  objects can be used as data structures defined in
  &MatricesForHomalg; on which the &homalg; project can rely to do
  homological computations over graded rings.
  
  <P/>The virtual rings most prominently can be used with methods known
  from general &homalg; rings. The methods for doing the computations
  are presented in the appendix (<Ref Appendix="FileOverview" />),
  since they are not for external use. The new attributes and
  operations are documented here.
  
  <P/>Since the objects inplemented here are representations from
  objects elsewhere in the &homalg; project
  (i.e. &MatricesForHomalg;), we want to stress that there are many
  other operations in &MatricesForHomalg;, which can be used in
  connection with the ones presented here. A few of them can be found
  in the examples and the appendix of this documentation.
