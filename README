    README file for the `VirtualCAS' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    VirtualCAS-x.x.tar.gz
    VirtualCAS-x.x.zoo
    VirtualCAS-x.x.tar.bz2
    VirtualCAS-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    gunzip VirtualCAS-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf VirtualCAS-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzoo -x VirtualCAS-x.x.zoo
and so on.

(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `VirtualCAS'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Testing the package is possible by invoking

ReadPackage( "VirtualCAS", "maketest.g" );

from within GAP.

You need the computer algebra system Singular (version >= 3-0-4)
to run the tests.

You also need the package Sheaves from the homalg project to run the test.
You can download from:
http://homalg.math.rwth-aachen.de/~barakat/homalg-project/Sheaves/Sheaves.tar.gz

E-mail us if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
